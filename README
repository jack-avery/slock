slock - simple screen locker
============================
simple screen locker utility for X.

This is custom, with the following changes:
- the squares patch: https://tools.suckless.org/slock/patches/squares/
- the user patch: https://tools.suckless.org/slock/patches/user/
- a modification to show squares equal to the length of your current input

Requirements
------------
In order to build slock you need the following libs:
- libcrypt
- libX11
- libXext
- libXrandr

This patched version also has xrandr as a runtime dependency.

For Nix (and NixOS) users, the provided nix flake handles everything for you.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (slock is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install slock
(if necessary as root):

    make clean install

For Nix (and NixOS) users, a nix flake is provided:

    nix --experimental-features "flakes nix-command" build


Running slock
-------------
Simply invoke the 'slock' command. To get out of it, enter your password.
